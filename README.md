each roll occurs at 1/1000th of a second

## TALENT
* introducing talent in the game where every player has varying talent from 0 to 1 invalidates the game itself as the global sum does not become zero anymore

### Chosen Player vs Opposing Player
* assuming the opposing player is chosen at random
	* making the chosen player the player with the most points each time makes the winning player win the game as the winning player eventually snowball in points
	* making the chosen player the player with the least points each time makes the winning player vary from time to time
* assuming the opposing player is the player with the most points
	* making the chosen player the player with the least points truly equalizes the game where no player gets any lead and no loss
	* swapping most with least for both players yields the same outcome
* assuming the opposing player is the player after the player with the most points, the winning player varies from time to time with at least one player losing significant amounts of points (based on 3 observations)
* assuming the opposing player is the player after the player with the least points, most players achieve negative points where there is at least one winner (based on 3 observations)
* when I introduced talent into the game 
	* making the chosen player the player with the most points, the player with the least points wins the game
	* making the chosen player the player with the least points, the player with the most talent wins the game
* when I made one player have talent while the rest didn't, that player with the only talent wins each time

### Zero Sum
* introducing talent invalidates the zero sum
* rewarding and punishing the players respectively with the same value regardless of source upholds the zero sum
* rewarding and punishing the players with the higher roll or the lowest roll respectively invalides the zero sum
